Contact: Ida Ang (ia267@cornell.edu)
Affiliation:
  * Former graduate student from the Bouklas Laboratory at Cornell University
  * For more details on previous research an alternate contact is
    Nikolaos Bouklas (nb589@cornell.edu)

Details:
  * Built upon a previous hyperelasticity FEniCS tutorial which demonstrates a
    cube fixed on one end experiencing a twist on the other end
  * Paraview recommended for visualization of results

Specific FEniCS Details:
  * Demonstrates compressible and incompressible hyperelastic formulations
    * Penalty formulation: Incompressible, displacement formulation
    * Lagrange: Incompressible formulation is a mixed displacement, pressure
      formulation
  * Also demonstrates different formulations such as the energy minimization
    which is demonstrated in the original hyperelastic tutorial and a formulation
    that involves an explicit weak form.
    * See DemoHyperelasticity document for full details as well as comparisons
      of formulation reusults
