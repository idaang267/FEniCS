Contact: Ida Ang (ia267@cornell.edu)
Affiliation:
  * Former graduate student from the Bouklas Laboratory at Cornell University
  * For more details on previous research an alternate contact is
    Nikolaos Bouklas (nb589@cornell.edu)

Details:
  * Built upon the work of Corrado Maurini and Tianyi Li
  * Updated personally for use with FEniCS Legacy Version as of 2023
  * Paraview recommended for visualization of results

Specific FEniCS Details:
  * Demonstrates syntax details for using the SNES and TAO solvers to solve a
    constrained problem in FEniCS
  * SNES code specifically shows projection of boundaries to the mesh for
    visualization of boundaries where constraints can be applied
  * Use of multiple conditional statements in constraint declarations
  * Basic for loop to solve problem at multiple iterations
    (ie. Body forces are updated for convergence)
  * Multiple fields projected to the same mesh for visualization
