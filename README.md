# FEniCS
FEniCS code from research projects

Made to track old versions of personal code and personal edits made to FEniCS demonstrations (For example, 
the personal edit made to the hyperelasticity demonstration). This repository also contains the ancillary 
files for obtaining results (.csv) from ParaView using ParaView's macro function and plotting using MATLAB.
