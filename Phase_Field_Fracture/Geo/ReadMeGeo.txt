edge_crack.geo
  From Bin from prior project can observe wrinkling 
  Uniaxial loading of 3D mesh with edge crack to study crack nucleation
2D-Trapezoidal.geo
  Inspired by Geelen 2018 paper for stable crack propagation
3D-Trapezoidal.geo
  3D version of 2D-Trapezoidal.geo
3D-no-cut.geo
  From Jaemin from his project on tissue contraction
2DRectangle.geo
  Only four points defined
2DShearTest3Ref.geo
  Full shear test for plane stress for phase field formulations
  Contains three sections where the middle section is refined in a regularized manner
2DShearTestRefDis.geo
  Full discrete shear test for plane problems
  Contains three main sections where the middle section is split into six
2DShearTestHalf.geo
  Half shear test for plane stress
  Has no refined section
2DShearTestRef.geo
  Full shear test but mesh refinement is not regular within each region
  Was used to test asymptotic bcs
2DSquare3Ref.xml
  Square with discrete crack and 3 refined sections
CircleCrack.geo
  Crack within full circle domain
HalfCircleCrack.geo
  Half circle defined
SimpleCrack.geo
  Left hand side discrete crack for tension tests
tension_test.geo
