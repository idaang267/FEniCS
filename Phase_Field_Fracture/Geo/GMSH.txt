Download gmsh from the following website: https://gmsh.info/
You can download GMSH for almost any OS
Note that these instructions are for my personal Linux workstation

Rename to something simple "gmsh-4.6.0"
Copy from your downloads folder to /usr/local/bin/
    Start in the folder that gmsh resides in
    sudo cp -R gmsh-4.6.0 /usr/local/bin/
    Navigate to your base directory by:
      cd
      atom .bashrc
    Add the following line to the bottom of your .bashrc file
      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/gmsh-4.6.0/bin/
    Save your .bashrc file, close, and source it by:
      source .bashrc
    Now you can run from anywhere by writing in commandline:
      gmsh
    For opening a specific geo file
      gmsh name.geo

Instructions for converting a geo file to msh to xml
  gmsh name.geo -format msh2 -3
  dolfin-convert name.msh name.xml

You can use test.py to convert your xml file to xdmf to view in Paraview (Lines Below)
  from dolfin import *
  mesh = Mesh("name.xml")
  XDMFFile("mesh.xdmf").write(mesh)
